Advanced TODO items:
Do not do these items unless you are asked to do so specifically
1. Allow the coach to be able to add social media links to their profile as a feed.  I would like a way for the coach to add AI-generated content to their feed every couple days, but allow the coach to approve it before it goes live.
2. Create a "Learn More" page with information about the coaching program, complete with pictures from the gym
